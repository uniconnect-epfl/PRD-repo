# The Value Proposition

*Describe the value proposition and argue that it is:*

*1. Easy to communicate*
- The name is straightforward allowing for a direct understanding.
- The app has been kept simple to remove any overhead from the user's point-of-view.


*2. Defensible*
- Most social medias's business model is based on targeted ads and selling data. For this to be interesting they are incentivized to have as much user as possible each with as much connections, ideally not regular friends, as possible. Indeed, following a friend of mine doesn't tell much things about myself. However, following tech related accounts says a lot about me and makes me more relevant for tech related ads.

*3. Relevant*
- The lack of genuine relationship is an issue that rises among the youth
- The feeling of loneliness when you first arrive at University is shared by many students
  - testing workflow
